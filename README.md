### Welcome to my page for my coursework for BGG213

## I will add my class content here

- Class 05: [Introduction to R](https://github.com/macatbu/bggn213/blob/master/Class%204:%20R%20Basics/Class_4-_In_Class_Exercise.md).

- Class 06: [Plotting in R]()

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/macatbu/bggn213/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
